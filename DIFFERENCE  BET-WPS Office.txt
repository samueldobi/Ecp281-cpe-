DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE BRAIN CAPACITT
OF A SUPERCOMPUTER AND A NINE YEAR OLD CHILD 
FRANK-DOBI IKECHUKWU  ENG1804739 CPE 
In today's  class a discussion  was raised about  the brain power
Of a 9 year old child and if it is stronger  than that of 
A supercomputer. A student  was of the opinion 
That a super computer was more powerful as a 9
Year old child  didn't  know much  and was still developing 
he cited  . Another student also agreed that a supercomputer 
was more powerful  and cited an example from when a supercomputer
Beat a world chess champion. A student  disagreed with this line
Of thought  stating that computers were programmed to perform 
Specific tasks while humans had the ability to learn new things  and
Adapt to new information. Another student  countered this line of
Thought  and gave examples of computers learning  to learn in areas
Like machine learning  and artificial intelligence. The discussion  was 
Then Changed to the speed of a supercomputer  versus that of a 
9 year old.  Various students changed their stance on the subject 
And a lot of them agreed that a supercomputer  would definitely  be 
Faster while few still didn't  agree. 
Personally i felt that  a supercomputer  was neither faster nor more
Powerful  than the brain of a 9 year old.  The brain controls  so many 
Functions and responds at unbelievable  speeds. And it also has the ability 
To multitask 
According  to research,  a human brain is more efficient  and has about
A hundred  billion storage units which make it better in terms of storage 
Capacity.. But a computer  outperforms a human brain in terms of memory 
Retrieval and the precision of said memory.  While both have their  advantages 
The human brain has a slight edge
